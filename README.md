# NightOwl-GUI

NightOwl-GUI is a Python Flask Application, an upgrade of my NightOwl-CLI which i released a time ago and have been using personally. However, i though to give it a little upgrade. So that, we can work with the email files without the worries of clicking or downloading or executing anything from the email itself. 

This is pretty much a boiler plate for the time being, there is a lot to come to the project and will happen over time. I will be keeping this as an open source project with the sole aim to support he community. 

# Usage 

The usage is pretty simple, all you need is to supply a `.EML` or `.MSG` file. The data will be taken out and displayed to you automatically. 

1. From field
2. To field
3. Email Subject
4. Date
5. Email Body
6. IP Addresses (From the body)
7. Emails Addresses (From the body)
8. URLs (From the body)
9. Attachments (Name is displayed)

The attachments will be stored in the `/Uploads` folder. 

# Upcoming
